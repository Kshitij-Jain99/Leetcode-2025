 1. convert a number into English words by processing it in chunks of three digits
 2.  initialize arrays for place value words (like thousand, million, billion) and for digit and tens names. 
 3.  A loop processes the number from the least significant chunk (ones, tens, hundreds) to the most significant chunk (thousands, millions, billions).
 4. To convert each chunk to english:
    a. Handle the hundreds place if present (e.g., 567 becomes "Five Hundred").
    b.  Process the tens and ones (e.g., 67 becomes "Sixty-Seven").
    c. Append the appropriate scale word (e.g., thousand, million) based on the chunk's position (e.g., 234 becomes "Two Hundred Thirty-Four Thousand").
 5. track the scale by using an index (groupIndex) that increments with each chunk processed. This index is used to fetch the correct scale word (thousand, million, billion) from the thousands array.

/*
 1. Use a predefined list of numeric values and their corresponding English words to convert a number. 
 2. Process the number by matching it against these pairs from largest to smallest, dividing the number, and converting each part recursively.
 3.  start by defining a list of pairs where each pair consists of a numeric value and its English word, such as 1000000000 for "Billion", 1000000 for "Million", and down to 1 for "One".
 4. For a number like 1234567, we iterate through the list from the largest value to the smallest. We check if the number is greater than or equal to each value. If it is:
    Divide the Number: Determine how many times the value fits into the number (the quotient) and calculate the remainder. For 1234567, we match 1 Million, resulting in "One Million", and then process the remainder (234567).
    Recursive Conversion: Convert the quotient to words and recursively process the remainder using the same list of pairs.
 5. We concatenate the word for the current pair with the results from the recursive call for the remainder. This process builds the final English word representation from the largest units (like billion) to the smallest (like one)
 6. Iterate over the numberToWordsMap.
    For each pair (value, word) in numberToWordsMap, check if the number num is greater than or equal to value.
    If num is greater than or equal to value:
      a. Compute the prefix: If num is 100 or greater, recursively convert the quotient (num / value) to words and append " " (a space). If num is less than 100, set prefix to an empty string.
      b. Get the unit as the current word from numberToWordsMap
      c. Compute the suffix: If the remainder (num % value) is zero, set suffix to an empty string. Otherwise, recursively convert the remainder to words and prepend " " (a space).
      d. Return the combined result: prefix + unit + suffix.
